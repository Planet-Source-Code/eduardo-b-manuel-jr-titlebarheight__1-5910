<div align="center">

## TitleBarHeight


</div>

### Description

This is a very small function which is potentially useful for those who know where/how to use it. I used this function on several of my projects already if you're wondering if this code has any use at all. I'll post some of them later. This function also demonstrates the use of control arrays and loading objects during run-time and you'll probably learn the concept of form scaling.
 
### More Info
 
Target - The target Form
